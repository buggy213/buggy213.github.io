# current work

## [cake](https://github.com/buggy213/cake)
personal project to learn some compiler theory. targets C language and x86 backend. 

currently still very much in progress, and rather disorganized. uses cranelift IR to do code generation for now, though i plan to build my own in the future. structs and unions are not yet properly handled by code generation either. 

## [opencl-raytracing](https://github.com/buggy213/opencl-raytracing)
a bit poorly named, this is a big raytracing i hope to work on some. current goals are to focus on vulkan / dxr / optix / other hw-accelerated raytracing and learn more about these apis. 

i'd also like to explore:
- radiosity-based methods (lumen)
- volumetric path tracing
- spectral path tracing
- polarization aware path tracing
- physical-optics rendering
- good caustics (photon mapping, specular cuts, etc.)
- restir, restir gi, other "restir methods"
- neural rendering (denoising, radiance caching, etc.) 

## radiance
research project at berkeley's slice lab. currently, major work is being done on the muon SIMT core targeting a tapeout during this school year. i plan to work on building out a raytracing acceleration unit (think nvidia's rt cores, intel's rtu)

# prior work

## [bubble simulator](/projects/bubble-simulator)
based on the paper of Ishida et al. (2017), the code simulates bubble surface dynamics using a hyperbolic geometric flow. mathematically, every point on the surface is accelerated proportional to the mean curvature at that point. intuitively, bubbles minimize their surface area, so protruding or sunken in parts get "flattened out". 

combined with thin-film appearance model of Belcour and Barla (2017) within rgb pathtracing framework (hw3 from cs184).

## [python mce](https://github.com/buggy213/ast-experiments)
metacircular evaluator written in python. extremely simple implementation due to the highly dynamic nature of python, as well as built-in libraries for ast manipulation.

## [distpcsr](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2023/EECS-2023-235.pdf)
cs267 final project. implements a pcsr data structure in a distributed setting.

theory: supporting highly dynamic graphs with large numbers of queries and global graph algorithms running on it is difficult, especially when the data is sharded across many different machines. distpcsr addresses this with a pcsr data structure (essentially an array with holes in it) on each local "rank", and a routing layer for inserts / queries. it also supports global redistributes to load balance as well as graph-wide algorithms like bfs, pagerank, etc.

implemented in upc++ programming language, tested on perlmutter supercomputer.
