# hi, welcome to my personal website

my name is joshua, i'm currently a masters student studying eecs at uc berkeley. i (very recently!) did my bachelors in eecs at uc berkeley (2021-2025). i hope to study techniques for real-time raytracing, both on the algorithmic and compute fronts. i also want to learn more about physically-based rendering methods.

outside of school, i enjoy playing board games, cooking, hanging out with my brother, and playing rhythm games.

feel free to look around (though there's not much to see :p).
